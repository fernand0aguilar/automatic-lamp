I believe that becoming enlightened isn't a place where we got to, but rather how we travel to a place. The thing about all these studies is that it becomes very easy to speak about something based on a belief. But if it's only a concept or maybe a state of being, trying to become enlightened won't really help. As the goal becomes far and far every time, we sprint to it, it;s only by letting go of the expectations when things begin changing.

And well, what do I mean by these words at all? There is one truth to me which resonates most, and this is the fact that nothing and everything is the same. But for my own personal experience, to align with this is a whole another subject.

In the beginning I was ignorant, not really conscious on what it meant to grow as a human being in a society of complex interactions. Systems between computers, humans, hardware and software. But since now, after focusing on learning and becoming more than I was, these concepts are starting to click, you see?

Yet, even if my mind is capable of digesting English words, explaining a deep topic such as consciousness or enlightenment I still need to take these topic out of the theory plane and apply them into the reality that I am experiencing.

But this implies cleaning core concepts towards a selfless kind of being, which implies also forgetting judgments, meaning to write a verb in the first person to begin with. Because if I am reality, then reality itself can't be locked in a one dimensional pointer such as the letter "I" and the implied meaning of it.

Trying to explain or philosophize such topics is an attempt to accomplish the task of putting the notion of infinity inside a little box and then show it around the room. I don't think it's quite possible to accomplish this task of converting higher dimensions into only 3. To accomplish the task of becoming reality by itself implies removal of everything separating this which is real and what isn't. But how can we define what isn't real in the first place? Taking the fact that if something doesn't exists in the present moment than it's not real is unsatisfying for the ego.trying to rationalize everything. But it might actually be the answer for excluding all the noise coming from unproductive sources.

But hey, who am I to speak about what is real in the first place? A guy that can't go a week without jerking of might be struggling to overcome his addictions just as much as an alcoholic and if it takes pure discipline to become higher on life and reach the promised good land of enlightenment, then I might be miles away from it.

The only thing that keeps me on this path is that I have been outside of the matrix and going back isn't a strong option right now. So the path turns out to be the direction which I chose to walk on. And I have to start enjoying it soon. Because living alongside blinds and deaf is only making me doubt the power within me. Some days ago I wished to become better and now I see that this wish was fulfilled. I am honestly grateful.


Now I am starting to recognize the magic of the life. This marvelous intelligent conscientious maze morphing and ever changing. To be a player in this specific game means to test all and every skill of the hero. Bow is the only thing that is real, and this makes me wonder about my skills to actually manipulate reality.
