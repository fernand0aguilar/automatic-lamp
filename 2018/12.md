We are looking for a long-term and dedicated team member to join us on our mission. You will create and lead our technical team, and play a crucial role in our product development. This is a remote role, the founders are primarily based in Byron Bay with other team members in other cities around Australia and the world. We enjoy getting in the same room together from time to time, mainly for product sprints and retreats.

As lead developer (CTO by default - yay!) you will define the software architectural design, selecting the appropriate software technology stack, setting the technical vision for the organisation and writing the first lines of code to enable us to deliver a Web app, iOS app, Android app and backend services.

IN THIS ROLE YOU WILL
• Design and build software
• Define best practices when selecting the technology stack from creating specifications, to development, through to deployment
• Efficiently build our digital products, to serve our existing audience of 300,000 and position us to serve millions of people around the world
• Keep up to date with trends and emerging technologies
• Be involved in architectural discussions and help determine our longer term technology strategy
• You're at an advantage if you have direct experience yourself or via a small team that has built, launched and managed world class iOS or Android apps

Support and lead people
• Scope new features for our platform with the product team
• Help to hire, build out and lead a remote based technical team
• Contribute to the engineering roadmap

Communicate and collaborate
• Work closely with the founders to set the technical and product strategy for Mindfulness.com
• Communicate and collaborate with team members while providing regular updates on project progress and outstanding issues
• Continually share ideas and knowledge with the team, to upskill yourself and others around you

TECHNOLOGIES
• We have an MVP. It’s your job to re-architect and re-build our new platform to serve our existing community of 300,000+ users, and to scale this product into the millions
• Our current tech stack is based on WordPress, which we are migrating off (no legacy code - yay!).
• There will be an iOS app, Android app, Web app, and a backend API to service the front end apps
• Hosting will likely be with AWS or something similar
• Opinions regarding tools and techniques of Continuous Delivery, reporting and security as welcomed

TIMEZONE
The founders and core team work in southeast asia. While this position is remote and therefore offers flexibility, the Lead Developer will work closely with this core team - therefore we do require a significant portion of working hours to be compatible with AEST to allow for synchronous communication and to ensure work progresses quickly and smoothly, so we can all enjoy a good lifestyle.

WHAT WE OFFER
• Competitive salary package
• Remote working conditions
• Professional Development
• Flexible working hours
• Team retreats
• We offer Visa sponsorship. If you would like to migrate to the East Coast of Australia and live an idyllic lifestyle in Byron Bay or Sydney, we would be happy to manage and cover the cost of that for you and your family.
