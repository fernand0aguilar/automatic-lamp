And the worst possible way to start a text is to start without a clear idea about what I am going to talk about

But since everybody here is crazy and no one has a clue about what is really happening in our lives, it's up to the few who can love most the task of realizing what reality is and is not. In order to then understand and mentor those who are still awakening to the fact that science and the academia has zero clues about the very nature of reality. But you migh wonder, but hey Fernando. We know that there are atoms, and relativity, and all this kind of stuff, and quantum this quantum that. 
But no body has figured out what makes humans consciouss. And why are we here in this planet. And there must be a way for knowing what we came here to be. And if we are alive this means that there is a purpose for all of this. Often we keep secrets for ourselves and this is detrimental in the long term. Each secret is a lie that the ego is repressing to maintain the identity which is best suitable.
Not living according to our own terms leads to wasted energy and wasted time. If one is going to make the best out of the least, so be it. We should encourage more and support more those who are dreaming big and making it happen. The duty for putting people down in life is only for the ones which cannot stand someone better than it. We keep constantly searching for others and outside pleasures. Food, money, sex. These are all demons and at least you are not alone. Hang on there friend, you can grow beyound this desire to have sex and you can still use this because it is from where we all came here so it's important. We just need to make sure that our motivations are not corrupted and that sex isn't the end goal but rather an expression of love in our own language of actions. 
Love is such a high vibration that it can literally shift everything in reality for the better once we let ourselves feel and be vulnerable. It is counter intuitive. The more we allow ourselves to feel, the more intense it can be. And the more vulnerable we become. This is exactly the oposite of what is the ego agenda of identity protection and remaining this self-included box which sees itself as small and separated from all there is. Where in reality it is all part of this unique system formed by vertices and variables. When we sum everything up it becomes infinite because the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts. Not only the human society but the ecosystem and the planets itself. We all are respecting some higher order set of laws which are not imposed by the ones in charge but by nature itself. The ones in charge are just people who know what is best in some exctent. But again, by failing to recognize the interconectedness, the ones in charge never trully solve the problem completely. They either make some punctual regulations that end up being off or some changes which are benefitial to some but not to all. 
And how to solve this? Well, by beginning to see that there isn't one size fits all. There isn't one solution that will solve all the problems. And sometimes we need to recognize that some people need things that others don't. This makes the complexity increase exponentially, and thus the leaders are not focusing on side cases. They focus on a range which leaves, unfortunatly, people out of the focus. This creates poverty, crisis, and chaos. Leading to the rise of fascism that is directly attaking with violence these people who were left out, as if they were the ones to blame because it's too comfortable to do drugs instead of going out there and finding a job. Or that my country is way better that yours so I will prevent you from coming here to look for a better life. This tyrans still have love inside of them. But it's a very dense and rigid form of love which we call hate. They love hating others, and they have built their whole identity on top of this rigid form of love. The duality will be always present and it's up to us, the awaked childrens, to open the eyes of humanity. to wake people for what is love.
