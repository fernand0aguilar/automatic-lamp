Every thought that you generate in your mind has an impact in people around you.
```
If we think that the work we are doing is important, it is most important that you work upon yourself first. 
Because you cannot produce anything other than what you really are. 
You will only produce what you are into many different ways. 
Who you are, what your mind is, what your emotions are. 
How you are right now will manifest in every action that you perform in the world.
And once you have multiple position of responsibility, that is having a huge impact in many many lives. 
So you will be responsible for leading, not to be constantly striving to transform himself first.

And essentially leadership means either you are directly transforming lives of people,
or you are transforming situations which will internally transform lives for other people.
So transformation and leadership cannot be separated.
```

Leadership is transformation. 
Leadership is in a way, knowing the art of fulfilling everybody's aspirations.
Leadership is in a way, making people understand that all our aspirations are the same somewhere deep down.

**Essential business is human well being.**
It is only the scale and scope which is different from person to person. But everybody business is human well being.
It might be for himself, for his family, for the comunnity, for the city, for the country, or for the whole planet.
But if our scale is larger than individual well being, then you are a leader.
