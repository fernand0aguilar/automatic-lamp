 Speaking about wich, starting to write from scratch is usually a little bit meta, because It's far easier to type stuff than to stay in the attical of my head thinking endlesly about what am I going to write about. 
 
When it comes to making small progress, i have realized that frequency is usually high and thus the speed of the progress might be slow. because period is 1/freq and thus, it gets fractioned.

But in the concept of the spiral dynamics, i am beginning to realize that there is only so much work left to do. I am starting to see the complexity of this system and this is truly a marvelous thing.

Spiral dynamics teaches not only an conscioussness hyrarchy but also something that can be used to model what is that which we are currently experiencing in this exact moment. Going deeper into the subcounscious mind is a process of self observation and can be benefitial 
This is why we need to keep maing progress and cultivating curiosity. If this process of personal development is going to payoff in the future is still unsure, but what is available to do is an experimentation. 
If so many people have spoken about those topics It's probably because they knew something which I don't yet know.

**I'm going back to being a white belt in this work.  Talk is cheap.  Show me your weekly goal lists, your weekly accountability reports, and your weekly progress reports.**

* - we are made aware that science and technology is just a phase in human evolution: unless we evolve into the next stage, all the technological advancement in the world won't change the fact that we are just more evolved versions of the chimps at the start of the film 

* - it uses the concept of eternal recurrence: i think there are several infinite loops in the film, but the most significant one is Dave's regression into old age and death and then rebirth into something more evolved. As mentioned in the video, after destroying what man had created himself, we will be forced into a period of self reflection before we can be reborn into a more intelligent form.
