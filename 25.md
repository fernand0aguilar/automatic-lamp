Awakening is about waking up from the dream. It's about realizing that none of this is real. It's all a hallucination.
That's very important because that detaches you from the dream. You stop taking everything so seriously.
But you still gonna be in the dream. So long you're still alive, you still are in the dream.
And as long as you're in the dream, you might as well play the dream out well. Excellently. Develop yourself within the dream.
Development is about being able to play within the dream, in a more integrated and holistic manner.
To understand more of the dream, to appreciate more, explore more, experience more.
So you can be awaken. But you know, just because you are awaken the dream doesn't end. It keeps playing along no matter what. So we can begin to understand that no matter what choices we make, the dream will keep unfolding until death.
So it makes sense that if the dream is going to unfold no matter what, you might as well play the dream out to be the best dream that it can be. This is the explanation between what is stakes and stages.
