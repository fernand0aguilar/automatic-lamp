and if you shine yor light like a lighthouse, 
the right people will always find you
it all starts slowly,
getting to know eatchother
free to do what we wish.

be it as I want,
for a future that belongs only to us
that dream of yours,
we should always transform

there's a more intense version
daring for the future,
a version that knows about the present 
and remains silent about the past.

don't come with all your negativity, <it's not allowed here>
i'd rather have a hundred years going by thousands miles
than thousands years going by one hundred miles.

let's all take more risks, 
the worst that can happen?
broken memories
resulting growth, 
and movement torwards harmony.

Today is the moment of decision,
will you laugh at everything and then say goodbye--
or will you become corrupted like a lost cause?
