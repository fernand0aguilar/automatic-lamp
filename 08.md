Talvez chegou a hora de perceber que para descer todos ajudam, mas para subir de volta é necessario me esforçar mais.

"What is an unpleasant measure of mental play, the principle of polarity and concentration on the Opposite Pole that it seems to suppress. I destroyed the nasty by changing its polarity. "- THE CAIBALION"

Today and the last night of my low period. After that I will enter into a positive spiral that will use Monalisa's law to make my dream manifest.
OK. now I have to plan some ideas.
I have the opportunity in front of me. How to act? Let's imagine that little bit of light has the capacity to transform my life. The way forward is a matter of believing. And always seek to grow.
Imagine and provoke reality.
imagine for real
really imagine
Imagine how crazy it would be to ride a bike.
imagine how we would like to tell the stars together
Imagine how cool it would be to travel together

That as if it were a dance, life puts us the best people so that we make our reality something much better. That is my purpose, to make your world much better.
Open this window and let in the braids of life.
My purpose in life is to give you the best of me.
My meeting is so particular when it is with you.
My life when I have someone to call life. My life is so special when I'm happy. Funny to think that I am here and always, I do not want to escape anymore.
I feel the excitement of making a madness out of love. Once again I find myself faced with a situation where I threw the dice on the table to play with the chance to succeed.
It's just that I have absolutely nothing to lose. If it works out super fast, if it goes wrong I'll have learned some lessons about myself.
And so be it, and that things happen according to the will of the universe, no matter the result, only the journey itself.
What I have to say, is being interesting. I've tried to love several different people. I want to see what it's going to be like when it finally works out.
Or fuck you. The journey of becoming the best version of myself is inevitably solitary. I can not control how others feel about me. I am doing my best to give love, and to always be in line with the best intentions and positive vibrations.
But now I do not expect things to work out right. Fuck you. lol
