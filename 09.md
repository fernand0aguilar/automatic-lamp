Right Woman
when I speak about love
it is just thinking about you.

And before we give it a name
It is thinking about you.

that I realize the meaning of forever
a feeling inside
a want and a trust.

when you was the kindest to me
time stopped for us to dance.
And now that it's again in movement

I write you this poem
hoping to feel
your heart beating close to me.
Thanks to you,

I realized that I am happy just being happy;
Thanks to you,
I realized that inside dwells what we'll ever need;

Thanks to you,
I realized that our level of communication is everything.
Here you read how I know you are right for me:

first
We can communicate well
We have fun together,
and we are going to evolve to incredible heights…

second
just remember that day jumping in the trampoline
I feel you thinking about me
and all I want to say is that you are right for me

third
I feel we are a reflection of each other
but there is so much going on.

How?
You appreciate me and I appreciate you
We have total honesty
and I love your body,
crazy sexy goat.

because the greatest relationships
are actually intangible.
appearance does matter,
but it doesn't mean everything.

and I'm open to give
with a level of transparency
if you allow it to be

I trust you 
with my spaghetti with all the sauces on it.
Now; I can express myself
I know that this something,
whatever it is - 

has a chance of evolution.
to live a life by your side
experiencing this heart connection
would be the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

A partnership of two light beings
planet earth appreciate us.
and just so you know
the focus is growing
what was only a seed
became a fruit tree.

Just like change and evolution
your scent is always present
into the wind 
and into the flowers.
